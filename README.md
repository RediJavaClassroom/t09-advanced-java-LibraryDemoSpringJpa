JPA : Java persistence API

Jakarta Persistence (JPA; formerly Java Persistence API) is a Jakarta EE application programming interface specification that describes the management of relational data in enterprise Java applications.
https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/persistence/package-summary.html
The Spring Data JPA is an implementation of the repository abstraction that is a key building block of domain-driven design based on the Java application framework Spring. It transparently supports all available JPA implementations and supports CRUD operations as well as the convenient execution of database queries.
